Better Webhooks
===================================

**Better Webhooks** is a Splunk app that implements a more-fully-featured alert action
for sending Webhooks. With it, you can authenticate your Webhooks (with either HTTP
basic auth, a custom HTTP header, or HMAC). Additionally, you can customize the HTTP
POST body.
